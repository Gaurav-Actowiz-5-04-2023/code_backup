In this case the sample plane will be conjugate to the light source, which can lead to forming an image of the light source rather than the sample. To correct for this, an input beam that is focused (i.e., K\u00f6hler Illumination) onto the aperture stop of the condenser can be used (blue ray). In this case, conjugate planes are created at the field stop, condenser aperture stop, and the objective's back focal plane. A collimated beam will then be present at the sample.

Designed for upright microscopes, these condensers collect light emitted by an illumination source to illuminate transmissive samples from beneath the objective . They are used in several transmitted light imaging modalities, including brightfield illumination , Dodt contrast , and differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging , and have an internal turret or tray to mount one or more condenser prisms, illumination masks, and/or other optics. Aperture Stop Diaphragm Each condenser is equipped with an adjustable aperture stop diaphragm that is controlled by a lever on the side. For the brightest illumination, the condenser's NA should be equal to or slightly smaller than that of the highest-NA objective that will be used with the microscope. By opening and closing the diaphragm, the effective numerical aperture (NA) of the condenser can be adjusted, allowing it to match the NA of the objective. Note that closing the diaphragm will reduce the illumination intensity. Condenser Mounting with D3N Dovetail These condensers can be mounted to a condenser holder using the male D3N dovetail on the bottom. D3N is Thorlabs' designation for the dovetail used by the majority of Nikon condensers for upright microscopes. See the Microscope Dovetails tab for more information. Condenser Trays and Turrets Each condenser is equipped with either an internal turret (Item #'s CSC1001 and CSC1002) or a removable tray (Item # CSC2001) to allow for the addition of DIC condenser prisms or other optics. See below for details on the options available for each condenser. Adapters for DIY Light Conditioning Setups For custom light conditioning setups, Thorlabs offers the CSA2001, LCPN1, and LCPN5 condenser adapters. The CSA2001 adapter features a female D3N dovetail and external SM2 threads. It can mount condensers with a male D3N dovetail to a DIY optical assembly that uses Thorlabs' SM2 lens tubes . The LCPN1 and LCPN5 adapters feature the same male D3N dovetail as the condensers on this page, allowing a user-constructed condenser to mount onto a condenser holder. The LCPN1 adapter has internal SM30 (M30.5 x 0.5) threading for \u00d830 mm lens tubes , and the LCPN5 adapter has internal SM2 (2.035\"-40) threading for SM2 lens tubes . Both adapters have cage rod through holes for our 60 mm cage systems . The LCPN1 adapter also has 4-40 tapped holes for our 30 mm cage systems. See the DIY Cerna Interfaces tab for a comprehensive list of dovetail and cage compatibility for the Cerna product line. These dovetail designations are specific to Thorlabs products and are not used by other microscope manufacturers. D2N and D2NB dovetails have the same outer diameter and angle, as defined by the drawings below. The D2N designation does not specify a height. The D2NB designation specifies a dovetail height of 0.40\" (10.2 mm). Click to Enlarge This photo shows the male D1N dovetail on the trinoculars next to the female D1N dovetail on the epi-illumination arm . Click to Enlarge This photo shows the male 95 mm dovetail on the microscope body and the female 95 mm dovetail on the CSA1002 Fixed Arm. Dovetails are used for mechanical mating and optical port alignment of microscope components. Components are connected by inserting one dovetail into another, then tightening one or more locking setscrews on the female dovetail. Dovetails come in two shapes: linear and circular. Linear dovetails allow the mating components to slide before being locked down, providing flexible positioning options while limiting unneeded degrees of freedom. Circular dovetails align optical ports on different components, maintaining a single optical axis with minimal user intervention. Thorlabs manufactures many components which use dovetails to mate with our own components or those of other manufacturers. To make it easier to identify dovetail compatibility, we have developed a set of dovetail designations. The naming convention of these designations is used only by Thorlabs and not other microscope manufacturers. The table to the right lists all the dovetails Thorlabs makes, along with their key dimensions. In the case of Thorlabs\u2019 Cerna \u00ae microscopes, different dovetail types are used on different sections of the microscope to ensure that only compatible components can be mated. For example, our WFA2002 Epi-Illuminator Module has a male D1N dovetail that mates with the female D1N dovetail on the microscope body's epi-illumination arm , while the CSS2001 XY Microscopy Stage has a female D1Y dovetail that mates with the male D1Y dovetail on the CSA1051 Mounting Arm. To learn which dovetail type(s) are on a particular component, consult its mechanical drawing, available by clicking on the red Docs icon ( ) below. For adapters with a female dovetail, the drawing also indicates the size of the hex key needed for the locking setscrew(s). It is important to note that mechanical compatibility does not ensure optical compatibility. Information on optical compatibility is available from Thorlabs' web presentations. For customers interested in machining their own dovetails, the table to the right gives the outer diameter and angle (as defined by the drawings below) of each Thorlabs dovetail designation. However, the dovetail's height must be determined by the user, and for circular dovetails, the user must also determine the inner diameter and bore diameter. These quantities can vary for dovetails of the same type. One can use the intended mating part to verify compatibility. In order to reduce wear and simplify connections, dovetails are often machined with chamfers, recesses, and other mechanical features. Some examples of these variations are shown by the drawings below. Click to Enlarge Two examples of how circular male dovetails can be manufactured. Click to Enlarge Two examples of how circular female dovetails can be manufactured. The table below gives the dovetail, optical component threads, and cage system interfaces that are present on each DIY Cerna component. If a DIY Cerna component does not have one of the standard interfaces in the table, it is not listed here. Please note that mechanical compatibility does not ensure optical compatibility. Information on optical compatibility is available from Thorlabs' web presentations. Thorlabs' optical component thread adapters can be used to convert between C-Mount threads, SM1 threads, SM2 threads, and virtually every other optical thread standard. Our cage system size adapters and drop-in adapter can be used to convert between 16 mm, 30 mm, and 60 mm cage systems. Our 30 mm cage plates can convert between SM1 lens tubes and 30 mm cage systems. Our 60 mm cage plates can convert between SM2 lens tubes and 60 mm cage systems. Attach to a ZFM focusing module to add a female 95 mm dovetail. The CSA1200 mounting arm is compatible with the CSN1201 and CSN1202 nosepieces. This blank arm is designed for custom DIY machining for non-standard components, threads, and bores. C-Mount and CS-Mount standards feature the same 1.00\"-32 threads, but C-Mounts have a 5 mm longer flange-to-sensor distance. The Cerna microscopy platform's large working volume and system of dovetails make it straightforward to connect and position the components of the microscope. This flexibility enables simple and stable set up of a preconfigured microscope, and provides easy paths for later upgrades and modification. See below for a couple examples of the assembly of some DIY Cerna microscopes. Build of a DIY Cerna Walkthrough of a DIY Microscope Configuration This DIY microscope uses a CSA3000 ( /M ) Breadboard Top, a CSA2001 Dovetail Adapter, our CSA1001 and CSA1002 Fixed Arms, and other body attachments and extensions . These components provide interfaces to our lens tube and cage construction systems , allowing the rig to incorporate two independent trans-illumination modules, a home-built epi-illumination path, and a custom sample viewing optical path. Cerna Microscope Platform Functionality DIY Microscope Configuration Assembly The simplicity of Thorlabs optomechanical interfaces allows a custom DIY microscope to be quickly assembled and reconfigured for custom imaging applications. The resolution of microscopy images is affected by several factors, including the numerical aperture (NA) of the condenser lens and the uniformity of the sample plane illumination. The NA of the condenser lens should be at least as large as the NA of the objective lens. Under these conditions, the condenser lens illuminates the sample over a range of angles that is at least as wide as the range of angles over which the objective lens collects light from the sample. In order to provide uniform illumination of the sample plane, a technique called K\u00f6hler illumination is often used. An important result of this illumination approach is that the source and sample are never imaged to the same plane. The following include more information about the relationship between the condenser and objective lenses, as well as K\u00f6hler illumination: Does the condenser's NA affect the microscope's resolution? How does K\u00f6hler illumination work in microscopy? Click here for more Insights about lab practices and equipment. Click to Enlarge Figure 2 : In epi-illumination microscopes, the objective provides the light that illuminates the sample. It also collects the light reflected and scattered from the sample. Due to this, and in contrast to the case illustrated in Figure 1, both the illumination and imaging angles depend only on the objective. Click to Enlarge Figure 1 : In transmitted light microscopes, light from the light source is directed to the sample by the condenser optical system. The objective lens is used to collect the transmitted light. This collected light is then routed to create an image at a camera or eyepiece. Click to Enlarge Figure 3 : Cones describe the light incident on a sample point from the condenser (left, gold), the light transmitted through the sample (right, yellow), and the range of light the objective can collect (right, orange). The cones' angles are measured from the optical axis. The angular ranges of the light cones incident on and transmitted by the sample are approximately the same ( \u03b8 cd ), since light that is not absorbed or scattered by the sample travels in an approximately straight line. The angular range ( \u03b8 obj ) accepted by the objective lens is can be different. The numerical apertures of the condenser ( NA cd ) and objective ( NA obj ) are often used to compare the angular ranges of the transmitted light to the light the objective lens can gather. The condenser's numerical aperture (NA) strongly impacts a microscope's resolution, since the angular range of the light incident on the sample affects the angular range of light transmitted or reflected by the sample. According to a general rule for optimizing resolution, the condenser NA should be as least as large as the objective NA. In other words, the cone of light provided by the condenser should have an angular range that matches or exceeds that accepted by the objective lens. Condenser and Objective In transmitted light microscopy, the condenser collects light from the source and illuminates the sample (Figure 1). The condenser optica system typically includes several optical elements, which can be aligned to provide uniform illumination of the sample plane . The objective lens is located on the opposite side of the sample plane and collects the light that is transmitted through the sample. This light is then routed to create an image at an eyepiece or camera. Alternately, the microscope can be configured so the objective both illuminates and collects light from the sample (Figure 2). In this case, there is no separate condenser lens system. Numerical Aperture The condenser provides light to the sample plane over a range of different angles (Figure 3). A cone, drawn with its tip at a point on the sample and its base encircling the light from the condenser, can be used to quantify the range of incident angles ( \u03b8 cd ) . The light transmitted by this point on the sample has approximately the same angular range. A different cone can be used to depict the angular range of light ( \u03b8 obj ) the objective lens is capable of gathering. These angular ranges can be quantified by each lens' numerical aperture (NA), NA = n sin( \u03b8 ), which depends on the half-angle ( \u03b8 ) of the cone, as well as the surrounding medium's refractive index ( n ). The higher the NA, the wider the cone describing the angular range. This angle is measured from the optical axis. As an example, when the objective lens has a 0.7 NA with air ( n = 1) between the lens and sample, the lens' angle of acceptance is \u03b8 = \u03b8 obj = 44.43\u00b0 . For the system illustrated in Figure 2, the NA of the illumination and the NA of the collected light are the same, since both light paths pass through the objective lens. Resolution The resolution ( \u03b4 ) of the microscope describes its ability to image two closely spaced points as a separable pair, instead of as a single point. A common equation, used to estimate this minimum separation includes only the wavelength ( ) and the NA of the objective ( NA obj ). While this equation seems to suggest the NA of the condenser ( NA cd ) does not affect resolution, this is not the case. This equationactually assumes that NA cd \u2265 NA obj . When NA cd \u2264 NA obj , a modified version of the equation, provides a better estimate and illustrates the importance of the condenser's NA to the resolution. Click to Enlarge Figure 4 : An image of the source includes the structure of the light emitting elements (left). K\u00f6hler illumination avoids imaging the source to the sample or sensor planes and provides uniform illumination to the sample plane (right). A multi-element microscopy system can be aligned to provide K\u00f6hler (Koehler) illumination, in which the light collected from a light source like a lamp or light emitting diode (LED) is imaged differently than the light collected from the sample. The light source is intentionally never imaged to the sample (object) plane or to the camera sensor. The sample plane is instead uniformly illuminated, typically over the broad range of angles required for high-resolution imaging . As a result, K\u00f6hler illumination prevents superimposing an image of the lamp or LED structure onto the camera sensor. Image of the Light Source An image of the light source at the sample plane would not uniformly illuminate the sample (Figure 4, left, for example), since the light-emitting structures are clearly visible in images of the source. K\u00f6hler illumination instead uniformly illuminates the sample plane (Figure 4, right) by providing the light to the sample plane as bundles of parallel rays. In addition, aligning the system to provide K\u00f6hler illumination prevents the light source from being imaged at the camera sensor, which would superimpose an image of the light-emitting structures onto the image of the sample. Illumination Light Path The illumination path begins with the light source and passes through the sample to the camera sensor. The video animation (Video 1, below) traces rays from an extended source, like a lamp or LED, through this light path. Each of the multiple light-emitting points on the source radiate light over a range of angles. The collector lens gathers this light and transmits a beam whose maximum diameter is limited by the field stop. The light is then incident on the field lens, which forms an image of each source point at the aperture stop. The alignment of the source image at the aperture stop is critical, since the aperture stop is positioned at the front focal plane of the condenser lens. The image of the source at the aperture stop provides light to the condenser lens, which transmits the light as bundles of parallel rays. Each bundle of rays originates from a unique point on the source image. The angle at which a particular bundle of rays is incident on the sample plane is larger when the source point is displaced farther from the optical axis. In other words, closing the aperture stop would reduce the range of illumination angles, as well as the illumination intensity at the sample plane. Since an image of the source is at the front focal plane of the condenser lens, only bundles of parallel rays are incident on the sample plane. No source image is formed at the sample and the illumination is uniform. Source light transmitted through the sample plane is imaged to the objective back focal plane, which is located between the objective and tube lenses. No image of the light source is formed on the camera sensor, which preserves image quality. Imaging Light Path The imaging path begins at the sample plane and ends at the camera sensor, and the video animation also traces rays through this light path. Each point on the sample is imaged to a point on the camera sensor. Kholer Illumination Animation Video 1 : Optical elements in a transmission microscope, labeled on the left, are shown after they have been aligned to provide K\u00f6hler illumination. Under these conditions, as illustrated by the light rays traced through the illumination path in the animation, the sample plane is uniformly illuminated and images of the light source are not superimposed on the sample or camera sensor. In contrast, the light rays traced through the imaging path illustrate that the same optics do image the sample plane onto the camera sensor.

Bayonet Mount: A form of mechanical attachment with tabs on the male end that fit into L-shaped slots on the female end. Bellows: A tube with accordion-shaped rubber sides for a flexible, light-tight extension between the microscope body and the objective. Breadboard: A flat structure with regularly spaced tapped holes for DIY construction. Dovetail: A form of mechanical attachment for many microscopy components. A linear dovetail allows flexible positioning along one dimension before being locked down, while a circular dovetail secures the component in one position. See the Microscope Dovetails tab or here for details. Epi-Illumination: Illumination on the same side of the sample as the viewing apparatus. Epi-fluorescence, reflected light, and confocal microscopy are some examples of imaging modalities that utilize epi-illumination. Filter Cube: A cube that holds filters and other optical elements at the correct orientations for microscopy. For example, filter cubes are essential for fluorescence microscopy and reflected light microscopy . K\u00f6hler Illumination: A method of illumination that utilizes various optical elements to defocus and flatten the intensity of light across the field of view in the sample plane. A condenser and light collimator are necessary for this technique. Nosepiece: A type of arm used to hold the microscope objective in the optical path of the microscope. Optical Path: The path light follows through the microscope. Rail Height: The height of the support rail of the microscope body. Throat Depth: The distance from the vertical portion of the optical path to the edge of the support rail of the microscope body. The size of the throat depth, along with the working height, determine the working space available for microscopy. Trans-Illumination: Illumination on the opposite side of the sample as the viewing apparatus. Brightfield , differential interference contrast (DIC) , Dodt gradient contrast , and darkfield microscopy are some examples of imaging modalities that utilize trans-illumination. Working Height: The height of the support rail of the microscope body plus the height of the base. The size of the working height, along with the throat depth, determine the working space available for microscopy. Click to Enlarge Cerna Microscope Body Click to Enlarge Body Details The microscope body provides the foundation of any Cerna microscope. The support rail utilizes 95 mm rails machined to a high angular tolerance to ensure an aligned optical path and perpendicularity with the optical table. The support rail height chosen (350 - 600 mm) determines the vertical range available for experiments and microscopy components. The 7.74\" throat depth, or distance from the optical path to the support rail, provides a large working space for experiments. Components attach to the body by way of either a linear dovetail on the support rail, or a circular dovetail on the epi-illumination arm (on certain models). Please see the Microscope Dovetails tab or here for further details. Click to Enlarge Illumination with a Cerna microscope can come from above (yellow) or below (orange). Illumination sources (green) attach to either. Using the Cerna microscope body, a sample can be illuminated in two directions: from above (epi-illumination, see yellow components to the right) or from below (trans-illumination, see orange components to the right). Epi-illumination illuminates on the same side of the sample as the viewing apparatus; therefore, the light from the illumination source (green) and the light from the sample plane share a portion of the optical path. It is used in fluorescence, confocal, and reflected light microscopy. Epi-illumination modules, which direct and condition light along the optical path, are attached to the epi-illumination arm of the microscope body via a circular D1N dovetail (see the Microscope Dovetails tab or here for details). Multiple epi-illumination modules are available, as well as breadboard tops, which have regularly spaced tapped holes for custom designs. Trans-illumination illuminates from the opposite side of the sample as the viewing apparatus. Example imaging modalities include brightfield, differential interference contrast (DIC), Dodt gradient contrast, oblique, and darkfield microscopy. Trans-illumination modules, which condition light (on certain models) and direct it along the optical path, are attached to the support rail of the microscope body via a linear dovetail (see Microscope Dovetails tab or here ). Please note that certain imaging modalities will require additional optics to alter the properties of the beam; these optics may be easily incorporated in the optical path via lens tubes and cage systems . In addition, Thorlabs offers condensers, which reshape input collimated light to help create optimal K\u00f6hler illumination. These attach to a mounting arm, which holds the condenser at the throat depth, or the distance from the optical path to the support rail. The arm attaches to a focusing module, used for aligning the condenser with respect to the sample and trans-illumination module. Click to Enlarge Light from the sample plane is collected through an objective (blue) and viewed using trinocs or other optical ports (pink). Once illuminated, examining a sample with a microscope requires both focusing on the sample plane (see blue components to the right) and visualizing the resulting image (see pink components). A microscope objective collects and magnifies light from the sample plane for imaging. On the Cerna microscope, the objective is threaded onto a nosepiece, which holds the objective at the throat depth, or the distance from the optical path to the support rail of the microscope body. This nosepiece is secured to a motorized focusing module, used for focusing the objective as well as for moving it out of the way for sample handling. To ensure a light-tight path from the objective, the microscope body comes with a bellows (not pictured). Various modules are available for sample viewing and data collection. Trinoculars have three points of vision to view the sample directly as well as with a camera. Double camera ports redirect or split the optical path among two viewing channels. Camera tubes increase or decrease the image magnification. For data collection, Thorlabs offers both cameras and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), the latter being necessary to detect fluorescence signals for confocal microscopy. Breadboard tops provide functionality for custom-designed data collection setups. Modules are attached to the microscope body via a circular dovetail (see the Microscope Dovetails tab or here for details). Click to Enlarge The rigid stand (purple) pictured is one of various sample mounting options available. Various sample and equipment mounting options are available to take advantage of the large working space of this microscope system. Large samples and ancillary equipment can be mounted via mounting platforms, which fit around the microscope body and utilize a breadboard design with regularly spaced tapped through holes. Small samples can be mounted on rigid stands (for example, see the purple component to the right), which have holders for different methods of sample preparation and data collection, such as slides, well plates, and petri dishes. For more traditional sample mounting, slides can also be mounted directly onto the microscope body via a manual XY stage. The rigid stands can translate by way of motorized stages (sold separately), while the mounting platforms contain built-in mechanics for motorized or manual translation. Rigid stands can also be mounted on top of the mounting platforms for independent and synchronized movement of multiple instruments, if you are interested in performing experiments simultaneously during microscopy.

Designed for upright microscopes, these condensers collect light emitted by an illumination source</a> to illuminate transmissive samples from beneath the objective</a>. They are used in several transmitted light imaging modalities, including brightfield illumination</a>, Dodt contrast</a>, and differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging</a>, and have an internal turret or tray to mount one or more condenser prisms, illumination masks, and/or other optics.</p> <p><strong>Aperture Stop Diaphragm</strong><br>Each condenser is equipped with an adjustable aperture stop diaphragm that is controlled by a lever on the side. For the brightest illumination, the condenser's NA should be equal to or slightly smaller than that of the highest-NA objective that will be used with the microscope. By opening and closing the diaphragm, the effective numerical aperture (NA) of the condenser can be adjusted, allowing it to match the NA of the objective. Note that closing the diaphragm will reduce the illumination intensity.</p> <p><strong>Condenser Mounting with D3N Dovetail</strong><br>These condensers can be mounted to a condenser holder</a> using the male D3N dovetail on the bottom. D3N is Thorlabs' designation for the dovetail used by the majority of Nikon condensers for upright microscopes. See the <em>Microscope Dovetails</em> tab for more information.</p> <p><strong>Condenser Trays and Turrets<br></strong>Each condenser is equipped with either an internal turret (Item #'s CSC1001 and CSC1002) or a removable tray (Item # CSC2001) to allow for the addition of DIC condenser prisms</a> or other optics. See below for details on the options available for each condenser.</p> <p><strong>Adapters for DIY Light Conditioning Setups</strong><br>For custom light conditioning setups, Thorlabs offers the CSA2001, LCPN1, and LCPN5 condenser adapters. The CSA2001 adapter features a female D3N dovetail and external SM2 threads. It can mount condensers with a male D3N dovetail to a DIY optical assembly that uses Thorlabs' SM2 lens tubes</a>. The LCPN1 and LCPN5 adapters feature the same male D3N dovetail as the condensers on this page, allowing a user-constructed condenser to mount onto a condenser holder. The LCPN1 adapter has internal SM30 (M30.5 x 0.5) threading for \u00d830 mm lens tubes</a>, and the LCPN5 adapter has internal SM2 (2.035\"-40) threading for SM2 lens tubes</a>. Both adapters have cage rod through holes for our 60 mm cage systems</a>. The LCPN1 adapter also has 4-40 tapped holes for our 30 mm</a> cage systems.

Components are connected by inserting one dovetail into another, then tightening one or more locking setscrews on the female dovetail. Dovetails come in two shapes: linear and circular. Linear dovetails allow the mating components to slide before being locked down, providing flexible positioning options while limiting unneeded degrees of freedom. Circular dovetails align optical ports on different components, maintaining a single optical axis with minimal user intervention.</p> <p>Thorlabs manufactures many components which use dovetails to mate with our own components or those of other manufacturers. To make it easier to identify dovetail compatibility, we have developed a set of dovetail designations. The naming convention of these designations is used only by Thorlabs and not other microscope manufacturers. The table to the right lists all the dovetails Thorlabs makes, along with their key dimensions.</p> <p>In the case of Thorlabs\u2019 Cerna<sup>\u00ae</sup> microscopes, different dovetail types are used on different sections of the microscope to ensure that only compatible components can be mated. For example, our WFA2002</a> Epi-Illuminator Module has a male D1N dovetail that mates with the female D1N dovetail on the microscope body's epi-illumination arm</a>, while the CSS2001</a> XY Microscopy Stage has a female D1Y dovetail that mates with the male D1Y dovetail on the CSA1051</a> Mounting Arm.</p> <p>To learn which dovetail type(s) are on a particular component, consult its mechanical drawing, available by clicking on the red Docs icon () below. For adapters with a female dovetail, the drawing also indicates the size of the hex key needed for the locking setscrew(s). It is important to note that mechanical compatibility does not ensure optical compatibility. Information on optical compatibility is available from Thorlabs' web presentations.</p> <p>For customers interested in machining their own dovetails, the table to the right gives the outer diameter and angle (as defined by the drawings below) of each Thorlabs dovetail designation. However, the dovetail's height must be determined by the user, and for circular dovetails, the user must also determine the inner diameter and bore diameter. These quantities can vary for dovetails of the same type. One can use the intended mating part to verify compatibility.</p> <p>In order to reduce wear and simplify connections, dovetails are often machined with chamfers, recesses, and other mechanical features. Some examples of these variations are shown by the drawings below.</p> <div width=\"100%\" style=\"clear: both;\"> <div class=\"imgFloatLeft\" style=\"width: 400px; margin-left: 8%;\"><br>Click to Enlarge</a><br>Two examples of how circular male dovetails can be manufactured.</div> <div class=\"imgFloatRight\" style=\"width: 400px; margin-right: 8%;\"><br>Click to Enlarge</a><br>Two examples of how circular female dovetails can be manufactured.</div> </div></div><div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"BC5A6CE4-62D5-4936-8AAD-640FD00CD834-10100\"><div id=\"A367A8E9-92DF-4100-B05A-9533C2D7B97B\" class=\"tutorial\" data-tabid=\"A367A8E9-92DF-4100-B05A-9533C2D7B97B\"><p>The table below gives the dovetail, optical component threads, and cage system interfaces that are present on each DIY Cerna component.

The NA of the condenser lens should be at least as large as the NA of the objective lens. Under these conditions, the condenser lens illuminates the sample over a range of angles that is at least as wide as the range of angles over which the objective lens collects light from the sample. In order to provide uniform illumination of the sample plane, a technique called K\u00f6hler illumination is often used. An important result of this illumination approach is that the source and sample are never imaged to the same plane. The following include more information about the relationship between the condenser and objective lenses, as well as K\u00f6hler illumination:</p> <ul> <li>Does the condenser's NA affect the microscope's resolution?</a></li> <li>How does K\u00f6hler illumination work in microscopy?</a></li> </ul> <p>Click here</a> for more Insights about lab practices and equipment.</p> <p style=\"clear: both;\"></a> </p> <p style=\"clear: both;\" class=\"tabAccentBar2 tabAccentBar\"> </p> <div class=\"imgFloatRight\" style=\"clear: both; width: 300px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 30px;\"> <br>Click to Enlarge</a> <p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: In epi-illumination microscopes, the objective provides the light that illuminates the sample.

The cones' angles are measured from the optical axis. The angular ranges of the light cones incident on and transmitted by the sample are approximately the same <nobr>(<em>\u03b8<sub>cd</sub></em> ),</nobr> since light that is not absorbed or scattered by the sample travels in an approximately straight line. The angular range <nobr>(<em>\u03b8<sub>obj</sub></em> )</nobr> accepted by the objective lens is can be different. The numerical apertures of the condenser <nobr>(<em>NA<sub>cd </sub></em>)</nobr> and objective <nobr>(<em>NA<sub>obj </sub></em>)</nobr> are often used to compare the angular ranges of the transmitted light to the light the objective lens can gather.</p> </div> <p>The condenser's numerical aperture (NA) strongly impacts a microscope's resolution, since the angular range of the light incident on the sample affects the angular range of light transmitted or reflected by the sample. According to a general rule for optimizing resolution, the condenser NA should be as least as large as the objective NA. In other words, the cone of light provided by the condenser should have an angular range that matches or exceeds that accepted by the objective lens.</p> <p><strong>Condenser and Objective</strong><br>In transmitted light microscopy, the condenser collects light from the source and illuminates the sample (Figure 1). The condenser optica system typically includes several optical elements, which can be aligned to provide uniform illumination of the sample plane</a>. The objective lens is located on the opposite side of the sample plane and collects the light that is transmitted through the sample. This light is then routed to create an image at an eyepiece or camera.</p> <p>Alternately, the microscope can be configured so the objective both illuminates and collects light from the sample (Figure 2). In this case, there is no separate condenser lens system.</p> <p><strong>Numerical Aperture</strong><br>The condenser provides light to the sample plane over a range of different angles (Figure 3). A cone, drawn with its tip at a point on the sample and its base encircling the light from the condenser, can be used to quantify the range of incident angles <nobr>(<em>\u03b8<sub>cd</sub></em> )</nobr>. The light transmitted by this point on the sample has approximately the same angular range. A different cone can be used to depict the angular range of light (<em>\u03b8<sub>obj</sub> </em>) the objective lens is capable of gathering.</p> <p>These angular ranges can be quantified by each lens' numerical aperture (NA),</p> <p style=\"font-size: 12px !important; text-align: center;\"><em>NA = n</em> sin(<em>\u03b8</em> ),</p> <p>which depends on the half-angle (<em>\u03b8</em> ) of the cone, as well as the surrounding medium's refractive index (<em>n</em> ). The higher the NA, the wider the cone describing the angular range. This angle is measured from the optical axis.</p> <p>As an example, when the objective lens has a 0.7 NA with air <nobr>(<em>n</em> = 1)</nobr> between the lens and sample, the lens' angle of acceptance is <nobr><em>\u03b8</em> = <em>\u03b8<sub>obj</sub></em> = 44.43\u00b0</nobr>. For the system illustrated in Figure 2, the NA of the illumination and the NA of the collected light are the same, since both light paths pass through the objective lens.</p> <p><strong>Resolution<br></strong>The resolution (<em>\u03b4</em> ) of the microscope describes its ability to image two closely spaced points as a separable pair, instead of as a single point. A common equation,</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p> <p>used to estimate this minimum separation includes only the wavelength <nobr>()</nobr> and the NA of the objective (<em>NA</em><sub><em>obj</em> </sub>). While this equation seems to suggest the NA of the condenser (<em>NA</em><sub><em>cd</em> </sub>) does not affect resolution, this is not the case. This equationactually assumes that <nobr><em>NA<sub>cd</sub></em> \u2265 <em>NA</em><sub><em>obj</em> </sub></nobr>.</p> <p>When <nobr><em>NA<sub>cd</sub></em> \u2264 <em>NA</em><sub><em>obj</em> </sub></nobr>, a modified version of the equation,</p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px;\"></p> <p>provides a better estimate and illustrates the importance of the condenser's NA to the resolution.</p> <p style=\"clear: both;\"></a> </p> <p style=\"clear: both;\" class=\"tabAccentBar2 tabAccentBar\"> </p> <div class=\"imgFloatRight\" style=\"clear: right; width: 350px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px;\"> <br>Click to Enlarge</a> <p><strong>Figure 4</strong>: An image of the source includes the structure of the light emitting elements (left). K\u00f6hler illumination avoids imaging the source to the sample or sensor planes and provides uniform illumination to the sample plane (right).</p> </div> <p>A multi-element microscopy system can be aligned to provide K\u00f6hler (Koehler) illumination, in which the light collected from a light source like a lamp or light emitting diode (LED) is imaged differently than the light collected from the sample. The light source is intentionally never imaged to the sample (object) plane or to the camera sensor. The sample plane is instead uniformly illuminated, typically over the broad range of angles required for high-resolution imaging</a>. As a result, K\u00f6hler illumination prevents superimposing an image of the lamp or LED structure onto the camera sensor.</p> <p><strong>Image of the Light Source</strong><br>An image of the light source at the sample plane would not uniformly illuminate the sample (Figure 4, left, for example), since the light-emitting structures are clearly visible in images of the source. K\u00f6hler illumination instead uniformly illuminates the sample plane (Figure 4, right) by providing the light to the sample plane as bundles of parallel rays. In addition, aligning the system to provide K\u00f6hler illumination prevents the light source from being imaged at the camera sensor, which would superimpose an image of the light-emitting structures onto the image of the sample.</p> <p><strong></strong><strong>Illumination Light Path</strong><br>The illumination path begins with the light source and passes through the sample to the camera sensor. The video animation (Video 1, below) traces rays from an extended source, like a lamp or LED, through this light path.</p> <p>Each of the multiple light-emitting points on the source radiate light over a range of angles. The collector lens gathers this light and transmits a beam whose maximum diameter is limited by the field stop. The light is then incident on the field lens, which forms an image of each source point at the aperture stop. The alignment of the source image at the aperture stop is critical, since the aperture stop is positioned at the front focal plane of the condenser lens.</p> <p>The image of the source at the aperture stop provides light to the condenser lens, which transmits the light as bundles of parallel rays. Each bundle of rays originates from a unique point on the source image. The angle at which a particular bundle of rays is incident on the sample plane is larger when the source point is displaced farther from the optical axis. In other words, closing the aperture stop would reduce the range of illumination angles, as well as the illumination intensity at the sample plane.</p> <p>Since an image of the source is at the front focal plane of the condenser lens, only bundles of parallel rays are incident on the sample plane. No source image is formed at the sample and the illumination is uniform.</p> <p>Source light transmitted through the sample plane is imaged to the objective back focal plane, which is located between the objective and tube lenses. No image of the light source is formed on the camera sensor, which preserves image quality.</p> <p><strong>Imaging Light Path</strong><br>The imaging path begins at the sample plane and ends at the camera sensor, and the video animation also traces rays through this light path.

This nosepiece is secured to a motorized focusing module, used for focusing the objective as well as for moving it out of the way for sample handling. To ensure a light-tight path from the objective, the microscope body comes with a bellows (not pictured).</p> <p>Various modules are available for sample viewing and data collection. Trinoculars have three points of vision to view the sample directly as well as with a camera. Double camera ports redirect or split the optical path among two viewing channels. Camera tubes increase or decrease the image magnification. For data collection, Thorlabs offers both cameras and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), the latter being necessary to detect fluorescence signals for confocal microscopy. Breadboard tops provide functionality for custom-designed data collection setups. Modules are attached to the microscope body via a circular dovetail (see the <em>Microscope Dovetails</em> tab or here</a> for details).</p> <div class=\"tableFloatLeft\" style=\"width: 180px;\"> </div> <div class=\"tableFloatLeft\" style=\"margin-left: 10px;\"> </div> <p class=\"tabAccentBar\" style=\"clear: both;\"> </p> <div class=\"imgFloatRight\" style=\"width: 250px;\">Click to Enlarge</a><br>The rigid stand (purple) pictured is one of various sample mounting options available.</div> <p>Various sample and equipment mounting options are available to take advantage of the large working space of this microscope system. Large samples and ancillary equipment can be mounted via mounting platforms, which fit around the microscope body and utilize a breadboard design with regularly spaced tapped through holes. Small samples can be mounted on rigid stands (for example, see the purple component to the right), which have holders for different methods of sample preparation and data collection, such as slides, well plates, and petri dishes. For more traditional sample mounting, slides can also be mounted directly onto the microscope body via a manual XY stage. The rigid stands can translate by way of motorized stages (sold separately), while the mounting platforms contain built-in mechanics for motorized or manual translation. Rigid stands can also be mounted on top of the mounting platforms for independent and synchronized movement of multiple instruments, if you are interested in performing experiments simultaneously during microscopy.</p> <div class=\"tableFloatLeft\"> </div> <div class=\"highslide-html-content\" id=\"ContentViewing\"> <p style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" align=\"right\">Close</a></p> <p class=\"tabAccentBar\" style=\"clear: both; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\"> </p> <p>For sample viewing, Thorlabs offers trinoculars, double camera ports, and camera tubes.

spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. A large difference in the relative response of the system from the UV to the visible inhibits reliable power readings in the UV when performing broadband measurements. Features in the UV may still be visible with the use of a bandpass or shortpass filter to prevent saturation at longer wavelengths. Note: These specifications are valid only when the spectrometer is used with the included fiber patch cable. See the Specs tab for details about the included cables. Models for the Visible, NIR, or UV to NIR Spectral Ranges Rugged Czerny-Turner Spectrometer Design with No Moving Parts Auto Compensation for Dark Current Noise Amplitude Corrected and Shipped with Calibration Report High-Speed USB Connection Allows up to 200 Scans per Second Trigger Input for External Synchronization (TTL) 16-Bit A/D-Converter 3648 Pixel CCD Line Array Includes Multimode Fiber Patch Cable Cosine Correctors Available Separately Allow Free-Space Input Round-to-Linear Fiber Bundles Optimized for Spectrometer Use Available Separately Below Thorlabs' fiber-based, compact, Czerny-Turner CCD spectrometers are available in three models. Two are sub-nanometer accuracy models that provide detection in the 350 - 700 nm or 500 - 1000 nm range. A third model offers a wide 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with better than 2 nm accuracy. With a footprint that measures roughly the size of a portable hard drive (122 mm x 79 mm x 29.5 mm), the performance of these CCD spectrometers is ideal for educational applications or fiber-based systems. Each unit comes amplitude corrected and is shipped with a calibration report. Although small, the unit shares features with larger, more expensive spectrometers such as the ability to be synchronized via a TTL trigger input (up to 100 Hz) and to automatically compensate for noise created by dark current. The three models share the same design with the CCD chips, gratings, and lenses being optimized for the specified wavelength range. Each spectrometer ships with an SMB-to-BNC adapter cable for external trigger signals, a 1.5 m high-speed USB cable, and a fiber optic patch cable with SMA905 connectors. The CCS100 and CCS175 include our M14L01 patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d850 \u00b5m core, while the CCS200 includes our M151L01 patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d8200 \u00b5m core. Each spectrometer is factory calibrated with the included patch cable prior to shipment; if a replacement patch cable is required, Thorlabs recommends recalibration using the new cable. Note that the spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. Thorlabs recommends recalibrating these spectrometers every 24 months and offers a factory recalibration service. To order this service, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Item # CAL-CCS2. Note: A glass window in front of the CCD causes etalon effects which vary from unit to unit. If you require more information to determine if these spectrometers are suitable for your application, please contact Tech Support . Mounting Options For ease and stability of mounting, our compact CCD spectrometers are each equipped with two bottom-located taps separated by 1\" (25.4 mm). The imperial versions feature 1/4\"-20 taps, while the metric versions are equipped with M6 taps. Software Package for the CCD Spectrometers The spectrometer comes with a software package that has a graphical user interface (GUI) and an extensive set of drivers (C/C++, LabWindows/CVI, Dot NET, NI LabVIEW a , and Visual Basic). The GUI can display the spectra, background, and peaks in a single window if desired. Additionally, diverse algorithms can be applied for smoothing, averaging, or calculating absorption and transmission. The measurement results can be compared with other stored profiles. The included drivers allow for complete functional control of the Czerny-Turner Spectrometers featured here, allowing the user to design his or her own interface software or to integrate the unit with a test and measurement setup for automated testing. Please see the User Interface tab for more details. The link to download the software can be found on the Software tab. This software package is also designed to operate our optical spectrum analyzers . Cosine Correctors Thorlabs cosine correctors (available below) are designed to mate with either an SMA connectorized fiber or the input port of our CCD spectrometer. They feature diffusers at the input apertures and allow the spectrometers to be used for free-space measurements. Fiber Bundles In addition to the SMA to SMA cable included with each spectrometer (detailed above), Thorlabs offers linear-to-round fiber bundles, which are sold below . These bundles are optimized for use with spectrometers and have a linear fiber array on the spectrometer side of the cable, which matches the geometry of the spectrometer slit. This provides higher signal levels in the spectrometer. Please note that while these bundles increase signal strength, a single small-core fiber should be used to maintain full spectral precision of the high-accuracy spectrometers. Thorlabs also offers a large selection of alternative fiber optic patch cables and bundles that may be purchased separately. For example, the M16L01 is an SMA-to-FC/PC-connectorized cable that contains the same fiber as the M14L01 patch cable included with our CCS100 and CCS175 spectrometers. Our reflection probe fiber bundles are a single-cable solution that connects to the spectrometer, light source, and sample for reflection spectroscopy applications (see the Application tab for details). We also offer custom patch cables, which can be ordered here . The software package supports LabVIEW from version 8.5 onwards. For earlier versions the code can be converted. Please contact Technical Support for details. The spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. A large difference in the relative response of the chip from the UV to the visible inhibits reliable power readings in the UV when performing broadband measurements. Features in the UV may still be visible with the use of a bandpass or shortpass filter to prevent saturation at longer wavelengths. There is a \u00d81.2 mm mechanical aperture adjacent to the entrance slit which limits the effective dimensions of the slit to 20 \u00b5m x 1.2 mm. See Slit Dimensions Note , below, for more details. Ratio of saturation voltage to dark current voltage. Scan rates up to 200 Hz (with 5 ms integration time) are only possible when using internal triggering. In external triggering mode, the maximum scan rate for the same integration time is 100 Hz. With 10x averaging, depending on integration time; for single-shot applications, signal-to-noise is limited by the dynamic range of the CCD. If the fiber patch cable is switched or replaced, the spectrometer will need to be recalibrated.

The package is designed for laboratory and manufacturing applications. The data, background, and peaks can be shown in a single graph. With the help of smoothing and averaging algorithms the user is able to enhance specific features of the spectra. Furthermore the software is able to handle several devices at one time which are presented in a single graph. The above screenshot shows the Peak Track analysis mode, which allows the position, amplitude, and width of peaks in the spectrum to be tracked over time. As long as track peak mode is active, the track peak analysis area will be displayed below the graph. A table with information on each peak is to the lower right while the lower left of the screen contains a small toolbox used to set the criteria for identifying the peaks. Additionally, Thorlabs provides drivers for C/C++, LabWindows/CVI, Dot NET, NI LabVIEW, and Visual Basic for more specific demands. The software package supports NI LabVIEW from version 8.5 onwards. For earlier versions the code can be converted. Please contact techsupport@thorlabs.com for details. Data Processing The software allows stored data to be loaded for comparison. This data can be used to calculate and show the absorbance, transmittance or relative difference view. TTL, 5V, Max 100 Hz USB Type Mini-B to Type A Cable Included Version 3.31 This version includes a GUI for controlling the CCD spectrometers, as well as a \"virtual device\" mode ideal for evaluating the software prior to purchase. The software package for Thorlabs' Compact CCD Spectrometers includes a GUI and instrument drivers. For information on writing your own application, including information on additional drivers and tools, see chapter 4 of the CCS Series Spectrometer manual . Each spectrometer is calibrated with the included patch cable. These CCD spectrometers can be used along with our reflection spectroscopy probes , broadband fiber-coupled light sources , and fiber probe holders to take diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and color measurements. Spectrometers Thorlabs offers several CCD-based spectrometers for use in the visible, NIR, or UV to NIR spectral ranges. The CCS100 and CCS175 operate in the 350 - 700 nm and 500 - 1000 nm spectral ranges with 0.5 nm and 0.6 nm resolution, respectively. The extended-range CCS200 operates in the 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with 2.0 nm resolution, but the UV range may be heavily attenuated when analyzing broadband spectra. Light Sources The SLS201L tungsten-halogen fiber-coupled light source delivers a 2796 K blackbody-type spectrum in the 360 - 2600 nm wavelength range and has active electronic stabilization for low spectral and intensity drift. Alternatively, the SLS203F Globar fiber-coupled light source provides a 1500 K temperature and 500 - 9000 nm emission range. We also offer fiber-coupled LEDs available with a selection of peak wavelengths or a broadband white-light emission spectra and our line of fiber-coupled laser sources offers a selection of options for intense single-wavelength illumination. Click to Enlarge Diffuse Measurement Taken at 45\u00b0 Using RPH Holder Block Reflection Probe Fiber Bundles Thorlabs offers reflection probes with either high-OH or low-OH multimode fiber for wavelengths from 250 - 1200 nm and 400 - 2400 nm, respectively. Probes are available with a sample end that terminates in either a \u00d81/4\" probe or an SMA905 connector. We also offer \u00d81/4\" and SMA-terminated probes with linear fiber bundle spectrometer ends that provide increased spectrometer coupling efficiency for samples with low reflectance. If the coaxial illumination provided by a reflection probe bundle is not critical, separate fiber patch cables or bundles with SMA connectors can be used for illumination and signal collection. Our large-core round bundles maximize illumination intensity, while our single-fiber multimode SMA patch cables are useful for precise illumination, or for connection to a fiber-coupled laser. We also offer round-to-linear fiber bundles , which maximize signal strength at the spectrometer. Reflection Probe Holders Thorlabs offers the RPS and RPS-SMA fiber probe stands (RPS-SMA shown above and to the right), which allow for precise, stable positioning of the fiber optic probe at an angle of 90\u00b0 or 45\u00b0 relative to the sample. The probe holder arms (also sold separately) can also be integrated into other optomechanical setups using \u00d81/2\" posts . Alternatively, the RPH and RPH-SMA probe holder blocks sit directly on a sample, allowing the fiber tip to be positioned close to the surface and also blocking out room lights from the area under test. Entrance Slit Throughput Comparison Our linear fiber bundles (sold below) can be used in place of the single-fiber patch cables included with these spectrometers to provide a significant increase in signal strength. The images below show how light exiting a linear fiber bundle more closely matches the geometry of the spectrometer's entrance slit than that from a standard patch cable. The accompanying graphs show comparison spectra of an SLS201L broadband light source measured with a CCS100 spectrometer when using a linear bundle versus a standard patch cable. As shown in the graphs below, the \u00d8105 \u00b5m core linear bundles provide a maximum power increase of ~500% versus a comparable single-fiber cable, while the \u00d8200 \u00b5m core linear bundles provide a maximum power increase of ~300%. 7 Fiber Bundle Click to Enlarge Single-Fiber Cable Click to Enlarge Left: Light exiting the end face of a BFL105HS02 linear bundle placed behind the 20 \u00b5m x 2 mm entrance slit of the CCS100 spectrometer.

Each spectrometer is calibrated using the included patch cable. All units are amplitude corrected and are shipped with a calibration report, which is valid for both the spectrometer and patch cable. Thorlabs recommends recalibrating the spectrometers every 24 months and offers a factory recalibration service. To order this service, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Item # CAL-CCS2. The input port accepts SMA905-connectorized fibers, and the CCSB1 cosine corrector available below can be used to adapt the spectrometers for free-space applications. Explore the tabs above for a detailed description of these spectrometers and their specifications. The spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. A large difference in the relative response of the system from the UV to the visible inhibits reliable power readings in the UV when performing broadband measurements. Features in the UV may still be visible with the use of a bandpass or shortpass filter to prevent saturation at longer wavelengths. Zoom Small Diffuser Connects to SMA-Connectorized Fibers or Spectrometer Input Port Allows Thorlabs' CCD Spectrometers to be Used for Free-Space Measurements Reduces the Source Alignment Sensitivity of Measurements Thorlabs' Cosine Correctors allow Thorlabs' CCD spectrometers to be used for free-space measurements. The correctors incorporate a diffuser in a tightly toleranced metal housing. The CCSA1 and CCSA2 correctors are designed to mate with SMA-connectorized fiber optic cables. The third corrector, the CCSB1, is designed to mate directly to the input port of the spectrometer. An image of each cosine corrector connected to a spectrometer can be viewed by clicking on the photos in the table below. Click to Enlarge The transmission of the diffuser material used in the cosine correctors. Each curve is normalized to the maximum measured transmission through that sample. Click to Enlarge The cosine correction plot for each diffuser can be viewed by clicking on the info icons in the table below. The diffuser in a cosine corrector allows light to be collected from up to a 180\u00b0 angle with the diffuser surface. This minimizes issues caused by sampling geometry inherent to other devices such as bare fiber optics or collimating lenses. As such, these diffuser packages are ideal for use in spectral measurements or as irradiance probes. A plot showing the transmission spectrum of spectralon is shown to the right. Each curve is normalized to the maximum measured transmission through that sample. Please note that the transmission is highly wavelength dependent when selecting a cosine corrector for your application. The cosine correction plot and transmission spectrum for each cosine corrector can be viewed by clicking on the blue info buttons ( ) in the table below. Determined by comparing the integration time of the CCS200 spectrometer with and without the cosine corrector attached.

Optimized for Use with our CCD Spectrometers Available with One Linear and One Round End or with Two Linear Ends Low- or High-OH, \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m Core Multimode Fiber Linear End Matches the Entrance Slit of a Spectrometer for Higher Signal Levels These fiber bundles contain 7 fibers arranged in a line configuration (linear) at one end and either a line configuration or a circular configuration (round) at the other end. These fiber bundle cables are commonly used to increase the coupling efficiency into spectrometers that have an entrance slit, such as those sold above. The linear end matches the shape of the entrance slit better than a single fiber or round bundle configuration, and therefore increases the amount of light entering the spectrometer. These fiber bundles use SMA905 connectors for compatibility with most spectrometers. They are built with \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m core Thorlabs multimode fiber with either a high or a low hydroxyl ion (OH) content for 250 - 1200 nm or 400 - 2400 nm, respectively. When plugging the linear end of the bundle cable into the spectrometer or another device, the fiber array must be aligned with the entrance slit. For ease of alignment, the fiber array's axis is indicated by a line on the connector sleeve. Precise alignment of the bundle and slit is not critical, but misalignment of more than \u00b15\u00b0 can cause a reduction in signal strength. In order to maximize signal intensity, we recommend rotating the bundle while monitoring light levels in the spectrometer, and then tightening down the threaded portion of the SMA connector to lock the bundle in place. When using these bundles with our CCD Spectrometers, the fiber array should be oriented vertically. Each patch cable includes two rubber and two metal protective caps that shield the connector ends from dust and other hazards. Additional CAPM Rubber Fiber Caps and CAPSM Metal Threaded Fiber Caps for SMA-terminated ends are also offered separately. Please visit our Round-to-Linear Bundles Page or Linear-to-Linear Bundles Page for full product details. We also offer 4-to-1 Fan-Out Cables with Linear Common End Configurations . Thorlabs offers a wavelength and amplitude recalibration service for our Compact CCD Spectrometers. To ensure accurate measurements, we recommend recalibrating the devices every 24 months. The table to the right lists the spectrometers for which the CAL-CCS2 recalibration service is available.

We also offer fiber-coupled LEDs</a> available with a selection of peak wavelengths or a broadband white-light emission spectra and our line of fiber-coupled laser sources</a> offers a selection of options for intense single-wavelength illumination.</p> <div class=\"imgFloatRight\" style=\"width: 170px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px;\">Click to Enlarge</a><br>Diffuse Measurement Taken at 45\u00b0 Using RPH Holder Block</div> <p><strong>Reflection Probe Fiber Bundles</strong><br>Thorlabs offers reflection probes</a> with either high-OH or low-OH multimode fiber for wavelengths from 250 - 1200 nm and 400 - 2400 nm, respectively. Probes are available with a sample end that terminates in either a \u00d81/4\" probe or an SMA905 connector. We also offer \u00d81/4\" and SMA-terminated probes with linear fiber bundle spectrometer ends that provide increased spectrometer coupling efficiency for samples with low reflectance.</p> <p>If the coaxial illumination provided by a reflection probe bundle is not critical, separate fiber patch cables</a> or bundles</a> with SMA connectors can be used for illumination and signal collection. Our large-core round bundles</a> maximize illumination intensity, while our single-fiber multimode SMA patch cables</a> are useful for precise illumination, or for connection to a fiber-coupled laser. We also offer round-to-linear fiber bundles</a>, which maximize signal strength at the spectrometer.</p> <p><strong>Reflection Probe Holders</strong><br>Thorlabs offers the RPS</a> and RPS-SMA</a> fiber probe stands</a> (RPS-SMA shown above and to the right), which allow for precise, stable positioning of the fiber optic probe at an angle of 90\u00b0 or 45\u00b0 relative to the sample. The probe holder arms (also sold separately) can also be integrated into other optomechanical setups using \u00d81/2\" posts</a>. Alternatively, the RPH</a> and RPH-SMA</a> probe holder blocks sit directly on a sample, allowing the fiber tip to be positioned close to the surface and also blocking out room lights from the area under test.</p></div><div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"00C0F10B-C784-4114-BF7A-32AFAB0FE2D1-3482\"><!-- Generated by XStandard version 3.0.0.0 on 2014-04-14T11:09:10 --> <p><strong>Entrance Slit Throughput Comparison</strong><br>Our linear fiber bundles (sold below) can be used in place of the single-fiber patch cables included with these spectrometers to provide a significant increase in signal strength.

These fiber bundle cables are commonly used to increase the coupling efficiency into spectrometers that have an entrance slit, such as those sold above. The linear end matches the shape of the entrance slit better than a single fiber or round bundle configuration, and therefore increases the amount of light entering the spectrometer. These fiber bundles use SMA905 connectors for compatibility with most spectrometers. They are built with \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m core Thorlabs multimode fiber with either a high or a low hydroxyl ion (OH) content for 250 - 1200 nm or 400 - 2400 nm, respectively.</p> <p>When plugging the linear end of the bundle cable into the spectrometer or another device, the fiber array must be aligned with the entrance slit. For ease of alignment, the fiber array's axis is indicated by a line on the connector sleeve. Precise alignment of the bundle and slit is not critical, but misalignment of more than \u00b15\u00b0 can cause a reduction in signal strength. In order to maximize signal intensity, we recommend rotating the bundle while monitoring light levels in the spectrometer, and then tightening down the threaded portion of the SMA connector to lock the bundle in place. When using these bundles with our CCD Spectrometers, the fiber array should be oriented vertically.</p> <p>Each patch cable includes two rubber and two metal protective caps that shield the connector ends from dust and other hazards. Additional CAPM</a> Rubber Fiber Caps and CAPSM</a> Metal Threaded Fiber Caps for SMA-terminated ends are also offered separately.</p> <p>Please visit our Round-to-Linear Bundles Page</a> or Linear-to-Linear Bundles Page</a> for full product details.

Note: These specifications are valid only when the spectrometer is used with the included fiber patch cable. See the Specs tab for details about the included cables. Models for the Visible, NIR, or UV to NIR Spectral Ranges Rugged Czerny-Turner Spectrometer Design with No Moving Parts Auto Compensation for Dark Current Noise Amplitude Corrected and Shipped with Calibration Report High-Speed USB Connection Allows up to 200 Scans per Second Trigger Input for External Synchronization (TTL) 16-Bit A/D-Converter 3648 Pixel CCD Line Array Includes Multimode Fiber Patch Cable Cosine Correctors Available Separately Allow Free-Space Input Round-to-Linear Fiber Bundles Optimized for Spectrometer Use Available Separately Below Thorlabs' fiber-based, compact, Czerny-Turner CCD spectrometers are available in three models. Two are sub-nanometer accuracy models that provide detection in the 350 - 700 nm or 500 - 1000 nm range. A third model offers a wide 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with better than 2 nm accuracy. With a footprint that measures roughly the size of a portable hard drive (122 mm x 79 mm x 29.5 mm), the performance of these CCD spectrometers is ideal for educational applications or fiber-based systems. Each unit comes amplitude corrected and is shipped with a calibration report. Although small, the unit shares features with larger, more expensive spectrometers such as the ability to be synchronized via a TTL trigger input (up to 100 Hz) and to automatically compensate for noise created by dark current. The three models share the same design with the CCD chips, gratings, and lenses being optimized for the specified wavelength range. Each spectrometer ships with an SMB-to-BNC adapter cable for external trigger signals, a 1.5 m high-speed USB cable, and a fiber optic patch cable with SMA905 connectors. The CCS100 and CCS175 include our M14L01 patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d850 \u00b5m core, while the CCS200 includes our M151L01 patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d8200 \u00b5m core. Each spectrometer is factory calibrated with the included patch cable prior to shipment; if a replacement patch cable is required, Thorlabs recommends recalibration using the new cable. Note that the spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. Thorlabs recommends recalibrating these spectrometers every 24 months and offers a factory recalibration service. To order this service, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Item # CAL-CCS2. Note: A glass window in front of the CCD causes etalon effects which vary from unit to unit. If you require more information to determine if these spectrometers are suitable for your application, please contact Tech Support . Mounting Options For ease and stability of mounting, our compact CCD spectrometers are each equipped with two bottom-located taps separated by 1\" (25.4 mm). The imperial versions feature 1/4\"-20 taps, while the metric versions are equipped with M6 taps. Software Package for the CCD Spectrometers The spectrometer comes with a software package that has a graphical user interface (GUI) and an extensive set of drivers (C/C++, LabWindows/CVI, Dot NET, NI LabVIEW a , and Visual Basic). The GUI can display the spectra, background, and peaks in a single window if desired. Additionally, diverse algorithms can be applied for smoothing, averaging, or calculating absorption and transmission. The measurement results can be compared with other stored profiles. The included drivers allow for complete functional control of the Czerny-Turner Spectrometers featured here, allowing the user to design his or her own interface software or to integrate the unit with a test and measurement setup for automated testing. Please see the User Interface tab for more details. The link to download the software can be found on the Software tab. This software package is also designed to operate our optical spectrum analyzers . Cosine Correctors Thorlabs cosine correctors (available below) are designed to mate with either an SMA connectorized fiber or the input port of our CCD spectrometer. They feature diffusers at the input apertures and allow the spectrometers to be used for free-space measurements. Fiber Bundles In addition to the SMA to SMA cable included with each spectrometer (detailed above), Thorlabs offers linear-to-round fiber bundles, which are sold below . These bundles are optimized for use with spectrometers and have a linear fiber array on the spectrometer side of the cable, which matches the geometry of the spectrometer slit. This provides higher signal levels in the spectrometer. Please note that while these bundles increase signal strength, a single small-core fiber should be used to maintain full spectral precision of the high-accuracy spectrometers. Thorlabs also offers a large selection of alternative fiber optic patch cables and bundles that may be purchased separately. For example, the M16L01 is an SMA-to-FC/PC-connectorized cable that contains the same fiber as the M14L01 patch cable included with our CCS100 and CCS175 spectrometers. Our reflection probe fiber bundles are a single-cable solution that connects to the spectrometer, light source, and sample for reflection spectroscopy applications (see the Application tab for details). We also offer custom patch cables, which can be ordered here . The software package supports LabVIEW from version 8.5 onwards. For earlier versions the code can be converted. Please contact Technical Support for details. The spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. A large difference in the relative response of the chip from the UV to the visible inhibits reliable power readings in the UV when performing broadband measurements. Features in the UV may still be visible with the use of a bandpass or shortpass filter to prevent saturation at longer wavelengths. There is a \u00d81.2 mm mechanical aperture adjacent to the entrance slit which limits the effective dimensions of the slit to 20 \u00b5m x 1.2 mm. See Slit Dimensions Note , below, for more details. Ratio of saturation voltage to dark current voltage. Scan rates up to 200 Hz (with 5 ms integration time) are only possible when using internal triggering. In external triggering mode, the maximum scan rate for the same integration time is 100 Hz. With 10x averaging, depending on integration time; for single-shot applications, signal-to-noise is limited by the dynamic range of the CCD. If the fiber patch cable is switched or replaced, the spectrometer will need to be recalibrated. Thorlabs offers a factory recalibration service, which can be ordered by scrolling to the bottom of the page and selecting Item # CAL-CCS2. The M16L01 is an SMA to FC/PC fiber patch cable that uses the same fiber (FG050LGA) as the M14L01 patch cable included with CCS100 and CCS175 spectrometers. Each spectrometer is calibrated with the included patch cable. The M91L01 is an SMA to FC/PC fiber patch cable with a wavelength range of 250 to 1200 nm that can be used with the CCS200 spectrometer. Each spectrometer is calibrated with the included patch cable. Note: These specs are valid only in combination with the included fiber patch cables.

The package is designed for laboratory and manufacturing applications. The data, background, and peaks can be shown in a single graph. With the help of smoothing and averaging algorithms the user is able to enhance specific features of the spectra. Furthermore the software is able to handle several devices at one time which are presented in a single graph. The above screenshot shows the Peak Track analysis mode, which allows the position, amplitude, and width of peaks in the spectrum to be tracked over time. As long as track peak mode is active, the track peak analysis area will be displayed below the graph. A table with information on each peak is to the lower right while the lower left of the screen contains a small toolbox used to set the criteria for identifying the peaks. Additionally, Thorlabs provides drivers for C/C++, LabWindows/CVI, Dot NET, NI LabVIEW, and Visual Basic for more specific demands. The software package supports NI LabVIEW from version 8.5 onwards. For earlier versions the code can be converted. Please contact techsupport@thorlabs.com for details. Data Processing The software allows stored data to be loaded for comparison. This data can be used to calculate and show the absorbance, transmittance or relative difference view. TTL, 5V, Max 100 Hz USB Type Mini-B to Type A Cable Included Version 3.31 This version includes a GUI for controlling the CCD spectrometers, as well as a \"virtual device\" mode ideal for evaluating the software prior to purchase. The software package for Thorlabs' Compact CCD Spectrometers includes a GUI and instrument drivers. For information on writing your own application, including information on additional drivers and tools, see chapter 4 of the CCS Series Spectrometer manual . Each spectrometer is calibrated with the included patch cable. These CCD spectrometers can be used along with our reflection spectroscopy probes , broadband fiber-coupled light sources , and fiber probe holders to take diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and color measurements. Spectrometers Thorlabs offers several CCD-based spectrometers for use in the visible, NIR, or UV to NIR spectral ranges. The CCS100 and CCS175 operate in the 350 - 700 nm and 500 - 1000 nm spectral ranges with 0.5 nm and 0.6 nm resolution, respectively. The extended-range CCS200 operates in the 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with 2.0 nm resolution, but the UV range may be heavily attenuated when analyzing broadband spectra. Light Sources The SLS201L tungsten-halogen fiber-coupled light source delivers a 2796 K blackbody-type spectrum in the 360 - 2600 nm wavelength range and has active electronic stabilization for low spectral and intensity drift. Alternatively, the SLS203F Globar fiber-coupled light source provides a 1500 K temperature and 500 - 9000 nm emission range. We also offer fiber-coupled LEDs available with a selection of peak wavelengths or a broadband white-light emission spectra and our line of fiber-coupled laser sources offers a selection of options for intense single-wavelength illumination. Click to Enlarge Diffuse Measurement Taken at 45\u00b0 Using RPH Holder Block Reflection Probe Fiber Bundles Thorlabs offers reflection probes with either high-OH or low-OH multimode fiber for wavelengths from 250 - 1200 nm and 400 - 2400 nm, respectively. Probes are available with a sample end that terminates in either a \u00d81/4\" probe or an SMA905 connector. We also offer \u00d81/4\" and SMA-terminated probes with linear fiber bundle spectrometer ends that provide increased spectrometer coupling efficiency for samples with low reflectance. If the coaxial illumination provided by a reflection probe bundle is not critical, separate fiber patch cables or bundles with SMA connectors can be used for illumination and signal collection. Our large-core round bundles maximize illumination intensity, while our single-fiber multimode SMA patch cables are useful for precise illumination, or for connection to a fiber-coupled laser. We also offer round-to-linear fiber bundles , which maximize signal strength at the spectrometer. Reflection Probe Holders Thorlabs offers the RPS and RPS-SMA fiber probe stands (RPS-SMA shown above and to the right), which allow for precise, stable positioning of the fiber optic probe at an angle of 90\u00b0 or 45\u00b0 relative to the sample. The probe holder arms (also sold separately) can also be integrated into other optomechanical setups using \u00d81/2\" posts . Alternatively, the RPH and RPH-SMA probe holder blocks sit directly on a sample, allowing the fiber tip to be positioned close to the surface and also blocking out room lights from the area under test. Entrance Slit Throughput Comparison Our linear fiber bundles (sold below) can be used in place of the single-fiber patch cables included with these spectrometers to provide a significant increase in signal strength. The images below show how light exiting a linear fiber bundle more closely matches the geometry of the spectrometer's entrance slit than that from a standard patch cable. The accompanying graphs show comparison spectra of an SLS201L broadband light source measured with a CCS100 spectrometer when using a linear bundle versus a standard patch cable. As shown in the graphs below, the \u00d8105 \u00b5m core linear bundles provide a maximum power increase of ~500% versus a comparable single-fiber cable, while the \u00d8200 \u00b5m core linear bundles provide a maximum power increase of ~300%. 7 Fiber Bundle Click to Enlarge Single-Fiber Cable Click to Enlarge Left: Light exiting the end face of a BFL105HS02 linear bundle placed behind the 20 \u00b5m x 2 mm entrance slit of the CCS100 spectrometer.

Click to Enlarge The cosine correction plot for each diffuser can be viewed by clicking on the info icons in the table below. The diffuser in a cosine corrector allows light to be collected from up to a 180\u00b0 angle with the diffuser surface. This minimizes issues caused by sampling geometry inherent to other devices such as bare fiber optics or collimating lenses. As such, these diffuser packages are ideal for use in spectral measurements or as irradiance probes. A plot showing the transmission spectrum of spectralon is shown to the right. Each curve is normalized to the maximum measured transmission through that sample. Please note that the transmission is highly wavelength dependent when selecting a cosine corrector for your application. The cosine correction plot and transmission spectrum for each cosine corrector can be viewed by clicking on the blue info buttons ( ) in the table below. Determined by comparing the integration time of the CCS200 spectrometer with and without the cosine corrector attached.

Optimized for Use with our CCD Spectrometers Available with One Linear and One Round End or with Two Linear Ends Low- or High-OH, \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m Core Multimode Fiber Linear End Matches the Entrance Slit of a Spectrometer for Higher Signal Levels These fiber bundles contain 7 fibers arranged in a line configuration (linear) at one end and either a line configuration or a circular configuration (round) at the other end. These fiber bundle cables are commonly used to increase the coupling efficiency into spectrometers that have an entrance slit, such as those sold above. The linear end matches the shape of the entrance slit better than a single fiber or round bundle configuration, and therefore increases the amount of light entering the spectrometer. These fiber bundles use SMA905 connectors for compatibility with most spectrometers. They are built with \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m core Thorlabs multimode fiber with either a high or a low hydroxyl ion (OH) content for 250 - 1200 nm or 400 - 2400 nm, respectively. When plugging the linear end of the bundle cable into the spectrometer or another device, the fiber array must be aligned with the entrance slit. For ease of alignment, the fiber array's axis is indicated by a line on the connector sleeve. Precise alignment of the bundle and slit is not critical, but misalignment of more than \u00b15\u00b0 can cause a reduction in signal strength. In order to maximize signal intensity, we recommend rotating the bundle while monitoring light levels in the spectrometer, and then tightening down the threaded portion of the SMA connector to lock the bundle in place. When using these bundles with our CCD Spectrometers, the fiber array should be oriented vertically. Each patch cable includes two rubber and two metal protective caps that shield the connector ends from dust and other hazards. Additional CAPM Rubber Fiber Caps and CAPSM Metal Threaded Fiber Caps for SMA-terminated ends are also offered separately. Please visit our Round-to-Linear Bundles Page or Linear-to-Linear Bundles Page for full product details. We also offer 4-to-1 Fan-Out Cables with Linear Common End Configurations . Thorlabs offers a wavelength and amplitude recalibration service for our Compact CCD Spectrometers. To ensure accurate measurements, we recommend recalibrating the devices every 24 months. The table to the right lists the spectrometers for which the CAL-CCS2 recalibration service is available. When sending the part for recalibration, please include the patch cable that the spectrometer is being used with. For more information, please contact Tech Support .

Two are sub-nanometer accuracy models that provide detection in the 350 - 700 nm or 500 - 1000 nm range. A third model offers a wide 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with better than 2 nm accuracy. With a footprint that measures roughly the size of a portable hard drive (122 mm x 79 mm x 29.5 mm), the performance of these CCD spectrometers is ideal for educational applications or fiber-based systems. Each unit comes amplitude corrected and is shipped with a calibration report.</p> <p>Although small, the unit shares features with larger, more expensive spectrometers such as the ability to be synchronized via a TTL trigger input (up to 100 Hz) and to automatically compensate for noise created by dark current. The three models share the same design with the CCD chips, gratings, and lenses being optimized for the specified wavelength range.</p> <p>Each spectrometer ships with an SMB-to-BNC adapter cable for external trigger signals, a 1.5 m high-speed USB cable, and a fiber optic patch cable with SMA905 connectors. The CCS100 and CCS175 include our M14L01</a> patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d850 \u00b5m core, while the CCS200 includes our M151L01</a> patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d8200 \u00b5m core. Each spectrometer is factory calibrated with the included patch cable prior to shipment; if a replacement patch cable is required, Thorlabs recommends recalibration using the new cable. Note that the spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. Thorlabs recommends recalibrating these spectrometers every 24 months and offers a factory recalibration service. To order this service, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Item # CAL-CCS2.</p> <p>Note: A glass window in front of the CCD causes etalon effects which vary from unit to unit. If you require more information to determine if these spectrometers are suitable for your application, please contact Tech Support</a>.</p> <p><strong>Mounting Options</strong><br>For ease and stability of mounting, our compact CCD spectrometers are each equipped with two bottom-located taps separated by 1\" (25.4 mm). The imperial versions feature 1/4\"-20 taps, while the metric versions are equipped with M6 taps.</p> <p><strong>Software Package for the CCD Spectrometers<br></strong>The spectrometer comes with a software package that has a graphical user interface (GUI) and an extensive set of drivers (C/C++, LabWindows/CVI, Dot NET, NI LabVIEW<sup>a</sup>, and Visual Basic). The GUI can display the spectra, background, and peaks in a single window if desired. Additionally, diverse algorithms can be applied for smoothing, averaging, or calculating absorption and transmission. The measurement results can be compared with other stored profiles. The included drivers allow for complete functional control of the Czerny-Turner Spectrometers featured here, allowing the user to design his or her own interface software or to integrate the unit with a test and measurement setup for automated testing. Please see the <em>User Interface</em> tab for more details. The link to download the software can be found on the <em>Software</em> tab. This software package is also designed to operate our optical spectrum analyzers</a>.</p> <p><strong>Cosine Correctors</strong><br>Thorlabs cosine correctors (available below) are designed to mate with either an SMA connectorized fiber or the input port of our CCD spectrometer. They feature diffusers at the input apertures and allow the spectrometers to be used for free-space measurements.</p> <p><strong>Fiber Bundles</strong><br>In addition to the SMA to SMA cable included with each spectrometer (detailed above), Thorlabs offers linear-to-round fiber bundles, which are sold below</a>. These bundles are optimized for use with spectrometers and have a linear fiber array on the spectrometer side of the cable, which matches the geometry of the spectrometer slit. This provides higher signal levels in the spectrometer. Please note that while these bundles increase signal strength, a single small-core fiber should be used to maintain full spectral precision of the high-accuracy spectrometers.</p> <p>Thorlabs also offers a large selection of alternative fiber optic patch cables</a> and bundles</a> that may be purchased separately. For example, the M16L01</a> is an SMA-to-FC/PC-connectorized cable that contains the same fiber as the M14L01</a> patch cable included with our CCS100 and CCS175 spectrometers. Our reflection probe fiber bundles</a> are a single-cable solution that connects to the spectrometer, light source, and sample for reflection spectroscopy applications (see the <em>Application</em> tab for details). We also offer custom patch cables, which can be ordered here</a>.</p> <ul class=\"tableFooter\"> <li>The software package supports LabVIEW from version 8.5 onwards.

As such, these diffuser packages are ideal for use in spectral measurements or as irradiance probes.</p> <p>A plot showing the transmission spectrum of spectralon is shown to the right. Each curve is normalized to the maximum measured transmission through that sample.

These fiber bundle cables are commonly used to increase the coupling efficiency into spectrometers that have an entrance slit, such as those sold above. The linear end matches the shape of the entrance slit better than a single fiber or round bundle configuration, and therefore increases the amount of light entering the spectrometer. These fiber bundles use SMA905 connectors for compatibility with most spectrometers. They are built with \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m core Thorlabs multimode fiber with either a high or a low hydroxyl ion (OH) content for 250 - 1200 nm or 400 - 2400 nm, respectively.</p> <p>When plugging the linear end of the bundle cable into the spectrometer or another device, the fiber array must be aligned with the entrance slit. For ease of alignment, the fiber array's axis is indicated by a line on the connector sleeve. Precise alignment of the bundle and slit is not critical, but misalignment of more than \u00b15\u00b0 can cause a reduction in signal strength. In order to maximize signal intensity, we recommend rotating the bundle while monitoring light levels in the spectrometer, and then tightening down the threaded portion of the SMA connector to lock the bundle in place. When using these bundles with our CCD Spectrometers, the fiber array should be oriented vertically.</p> <p>Each patch cable includes two rubber and two metal protective caps that shield the connector ends from dust and other hazards. Additional CAPM</a> Rubber Fiber Caps and CAPSM</a> Metal Threaded Fiber Caps for SMA-terminated ends are also offered separately.</p> <p>Please visit our Round-to-Linear Bundles Page</a> or Linear-to-Linear Bundles Page</a> for full product details.

Two are sub-nanometer accuracy models that provide detection in the 350 - 700 nm or 500 - 1000 nm range. A third model offers a wide 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with better than 2 nm accuracy. With a footprint that measures roughly the size of a portable hard drive (122 mm x 79 mm x 29.5 mm), the performance of these CCD spectrometers is ideal for educational applications or fiber-based systems. Each unit comes amplitude corrected and is shipped with a calibration report. Although small, the unit shares features with larger, more expensive spectrometers such as the ability to be synchronized via a TTL trigger input (up to 100 Hz) and to automatically compensate for noise created by dark current. The three models share the same design with the CCD chips, gratings, and lenses being optimized for the specified wavelength range. Each spectrometer ships with an SMB-to-BNC adapter cable for external trigger signals, a 1.5 m high-speed USB cable, and a fiber optic patch cable with SMA905 connectors. The CCS100 and CCS175 include our M14L01 patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d850 \u00b5m core, while the CCS200 includes our M151L01 patch cable, which is 1 m long and has a \u00d8200 \u00b5m core. Each spectrometer is factory calibrated with the included patch cable prior to shipment; if a replacement patch cable is required, Thorlabs recommends recalibration using the new cable. Note that the spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. Thorlabs recommends recalibrating these spectrometers every 24 months and offers a factory recalibration service. To order this service, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Item # CAL-CCS2. Note: A glass window in front of the CCD causes etalon effects which vary from unit to unit. If you require more information to determine if these spectrometers are suitable for your application, please contact Tech Support . Mounting Options For ease and stability of mounting, our compact CCD spectrometers are each equipped with two bottom-located taps separated by 1\" (25.4 mm). The imperial versions feature 1/4\"-20 taps, while the metric versions are equipped with M6 taps. Software Package for the CCD Spectrometers The spectrometer comes with a software package that has a graphical user interface (GUI) and an extensive set of drivers (C/C++, LabWindows/CVI, Dot NET, NI LabVIEW a , and Visual Basic). The GUI can display the spectra, background, and peaks in a single window if desired. Additionally, diverse algorithms can be applied for smoothing, averaging, or calculating absorption and transmission. The measurement results can be compared with other stored profiles. The included drivers allow for complete functional control of the Czerny-Turner Spectrometers featured here, allowing the user to design his or her own interface software or to integrate the unit with a test and measurement setup for automated testing. Please see the User Interface tab for more details. The link to download the software can be found on the Software tab. This software package is also designed to operate our optical spectrum analyzers . Cosine Correctors Thorlabs cosine correctors (available below) are designed to mate with either an SMA connectorized fiber or the input port of our CCD spectrometer. They feature diffusers at the input apertures and allow the spectrometers to be used for free-space measurements. Fiber Bundles In addition to the SMA to SMA cable included with each spectrometer (detailed above), Thorlabs offers linear-to-round fiber bundles, which are sold below . These bundles are optimized for use with spectrometers and have a linear fiber array on the spectrometer side of the cable, which matches the geometry of the spectrometer slit. This provides higher signal levels in the spectrometer. Please note that while these bundles increase signal strength, a single small-core fiber should be used to maintain full spectral precision of the high-accuracy spectrometers. Thorlabs also offers a large selection of alternative fiber optic patch cables and bundles that may be purchased separately. For example, the M16L01 is an SMA-to-FC/PC-connectorized cable that contains the same fiber as the M14L01 patch cable included with our CCS100 and CCS175 spectrometers. Our reflection probe fiber bundles are a single-cable solution that connects to the spectrometer, light source, and sample for reflection spectroscopy applications (see the Application tab for details). We also offer custom patch cables, which can be ordered here . The software package supports LabVIEW from version 8.5 onwards. For earlier versions the code can be converted. Please contact Technical Support for details. The spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm. A large difference in the relative response of the chip from the UV to the visible inhibits reliable power readings in the UV when performing broadband measurements. Features in the UV may still be visible with the use of a bandpass or shortpass filter to prevent saturation at longer wavelengths. There is a \u00d81.2 mm mechanical aperture adjacent to the entrance slit which limits the effective dimensions of the slit to 20 \u00b5m x 1.2 mm. See Slit Dimensions Note , below, for more details. Ratio of saturation voltage to dark current voltage. Scan rates up to 200 Hz (with 5 ms integration time) are only possible when using internal triggering. In external triggering mode, the maximum scan rate for the same integration time is 100 Hz. With 10x averaging, depending on integration time; for single-shot applications, signal-to-noise is limited by the dynamic range of the CCD. If the fiber patch cable is switched or replaced, the spectrometer will need to be recalibrated. Thorlabs offers a factory recalibration service, which can be ordered by scrolling to the bottom of the page and selecting Item # CAL-CCS2. The M16L01 is an SMA to FC/PC fiber patch cable that uses the same fiber (FG050LGA) as the M14L01 patch cable included with CCS100 and CCS175 spectrometers. Each spectrometer is calibrated with the included patch cable. The M91L01 is an SMA to FC/PC fiber patch cable with a wavelength range of 250 to 1200 nm that can be used with the CCS200 spectrometer.

The package is designed for laboratory and manufacturing applications. The data, background, and peaks can be shown in a single graph. With the help of smoothing and averaging algorithms the user is able to enhance specific features of the spectra. Furthermore the software is able to handle several devices at one time which are presented in a single graph. The above screenshot shows the Peak Track analysis mode, which allows the position, amplitude, and width of peaks in the spectrum to be tracked over time. As long as track peak mode is active, the track peak analysis area will be displayed below the graph. A table with information on each peak is to the lower right while the lower left of the screen contains a small toolbox used to set the criteria for identifying the peaks. Additionally, Thorlabs provides drivers for C/C++, LabWindows/CVI, Dot NET, NI LabVIEW, and Visual Basic for more specific demands. The software package supports NI LabVIEW from version 8.5 onwards. For earlier versions the code can be converted. Please contact techsupport@thorlabs.com for details. Data Processing The software allows stored data to be loaded for comparison. This data can be used to calculate and show the absorbance, transmittance or relative difference view. TTL, 5V, Max 100 Hz USB Type Mini-B to Type A Cable Included Version 3.31 This version includes a GUI for controlling the CCD spectrometers, as well as a \"virtual device\" mode ideal for evaluating the software prior to purchase. The software package for Thorlabs' Compact CCD Spectrometers includes a GUI and instrument drivers. For information on writing your own application, including information on additional drivers and tools, see chapter 4 of the CCS Series Spectrometer manual . Each spectrometer is calibrated with the included patch cable. These CCD spectrometers can be used along with our reflection spectroscopy probes , broadband fiber-coupled light sources , and fiber probe holders to take diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and color measurements. Spectrometers Thorlabs offers several CCD-based spectrometers for use in the visible, NIR, or UV to NIR spectral ranges. The CCS100 and CCS175 operate in the 350 - 700 nm and 500 - 1000 nm spectral ranges with 0.5 nm and 0.6 nm resolution, respectively. The extended-range CCS200 operates in the 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with 2.0 nm resolution, but the UV range may be heavily attenuated when analyzing broadband spectra. Light Sources The SLS201L tungsten-halogen fiber-coupled light source delivers a 2796 K blackbody-type spectrum in the 360 - 2600 nm wavelength range and has active electronic stabilization for low spectral and intensity drift. Alternatively, the SLS203F Globar fiber-coupled light source provides a 1500 K temperature and 500 - 9000 nm emission range. We also offer fiber-coupled LEDs available with a selection of peak wavelengths or a broadband white-light emission spectra and our line of fiber-coupled laser sources offers a selection of options for intense single-wavelength illumination. Click to Enlarge Diffuse Measurement Taken at 45\u00b0 Using RPH Holder Block Reflection Probe Fiber Bundles Thorlabs offers reflection probes with either high-OH or low-OH multimode fiber for wavelengths from 250 - 1200 nm and 400 - 2400 nm, respectively. Probes are available with a sample end that terminates in either a \u00d81/4\" probe or an SMA905 connector. We also offer \u00d81/4\" and SMA-terminated probes with linear fiber bundle spectrometer ends that provide increased spectrometer coupling efficiency for samples with low reflectance. If the coaxial illumination provided by a reflection probe bundle is not critical, separate fiber patch cables or bundles with SMA connectors can be used for illumination and signal collection. Our large-core round bundles maximize illumination intensity, while our single-fiber multimode SMA patch cables are useful for precise illumination, or for connection to a fiber-coupled laser. We also offer round-to-linear fiber bundles , which maximize signal strength at the spectrometer. Reflection Probe Holders Thorlabs offers the RPS and RPS-SMA fiber probe stands (RPS-SMA shown above and to the right), which allow for precise, stable positioning of the fiber optic probe at an angle of 90\u00b0 or 45\u00b0 relative to the sample. The probe holder arms (also sold separately) can also be integrated into other optomechanical setups using \u00d81/2\" posts . Alternatively, the RPH and RPH-SMA probe holder blocks sit directly on a sample, allowing the fiber tip to be positioned close to the surface and also blocking out room lights from the area under test. Entrance Slit Throughput Comparison Our linear fiber bundles (sold below) can be used in place of the single-fiber patch cables included with these spectrometers to provide a significant increase in signal strength. The images below show how light exiting a linear fiber bundle more closely matches the geometry of the spectrometer's entrance slit than that from a standard patch cable. The accompanying graphs show comparison spectra of an SLS201L broadband light source measured with a CCS100 spectrometer when using a linear bundle versus a standard patch cable. As shown in the graphs below, the \u00d8105 \u00b5m core linear bundles provide a maximum power increase of ~500% versus a comparable single-fiber cable, while the \u00d8200 \u00b5m core linear bundles provide a maximum power increase of ~300%. 7 Fiber Bundle Click to Enlarge Single-Fiber Cable Click to Enlarge Left: Light exiting the end face of a BFL105HS02 linear bundle placed behind the 20 \u00b5m x 2 mm entrance slit of the CCS100 spectrometer.

Thorlabs recommends recalibrating the spectrometers every 24 months and offers a factory recalibration service. To order this service, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Item # CAL-CCS2. The input port accepts SMA905-connectorized fibers, and the CCSB1 cosine corrector available below can be used to adapt the spectrometers for free-space applications. Explore the tabs above for a detailed description of these spectrometers and their specifications. The spectrometers cannot be amplitude corrected below 380 nm.

Zoom Small Diffuser Connects to SMA-Connectorized Fibers or Spectrometer Input Port Allows Thorlabs' CCD Spectrometers to be Used for Free-Space Measurements Reduces the Source Alignment Sensitivity of Measurements Thorlabs' Cosine Correctors allow Thorlabs' CCD spectrometers to be used for free-space measurements. The correctors incorporate a diffuser in a tightly toleranced metal housing. The CCSA1 and CCSA2 correctors are designed to mate with SMA-connectorized fiber optic cables. The third corrector, the CCSB1, is designed to mate directly to the input port of the spectrometer. An image of each cosine corrector connected to a spectrometer can be viewed by clicking on the photos in the table below. Click to Enlarge The transmission of the diffuser material used in the cosine correctors. Each curve is normalized to the maximum measured transmission through that sample. Click to Enlarge The cosine correction plot for each diffuser can be viewed by clicking on the info icons in the table below. The diffuser in a cosine corrector allows light to be collected from up to a 180\u00b0 angle with the diffuser surface. This minimizes issues caused by sampling geometry inherent to other devices such as bare fiber optics or collimating lenses. As such, these diffuser packages are ideal for use in spectral measurements or as irradiance probes. A plot showing the transmission spectrum of spectralon is shown to the right. Each curve is normalized to the maximum measured transmission through that sample. Please note that the transmission is highly wavelength dependent when selecting a cosine corrector for your application. The cosine correction plot and transmission spectrum for each cosine corrector can be viewed by clicking on the blue info buttons ( ) in the table below.

Optimized for Use with our CCD Spectrometers Available with One Linear and One Round End or with Two Linear Ends Low- or High-OH, \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m Core Multimode Fiber Linear End Matches the Entrance Slit of a Spectrometer for Higher Signal Levels These fiber bundles contain 7 fibers arranged in a line configuration (linear) at one end and either a line configuration or a circular configuration (round) at the other end. These fiber bundle cables are commonly used to increase the coupling efficiency into spectrometers that have an entrance slit, such as those sold above. The linear end matches the shape of the entrance slit better than a single fiber or round bundle configuration, and therefore increases the amount of light entering the spectrometer. These fiber bundles use SMA905 connectors for compatibility with most spectrometers. They are built with \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m core Thorlabs multimode fiber with either a high or a low hydroxyl ion (OH) content for 250 - 1200 nm or 400 - 2400 nm, respectively. When plugging the linear end of the bundle cable into the spectrometer or another device, the fiber array must be aligned with the entrance slit. For ease of alignment, the fiber array's axis is indicated by a line on the connector sleeve. Precise alignment of the bundle and slit is not critical, but misalignment of more than \u00b15\u00b0 can cause a reduction in signal strength. In order to maximize signal intensity, we recommend rotating the bundle while monitoring light levels in the spectrometer, and then tightening down the threaded portion of the SMA connector to lock the bundle in place. When using these bundles with our CCD Spectrometers, the fiber array should be oriented vertically. Each patch cable includes two rubber and two metal protective caps that shield the connector ends from dust and other hazards. Additional CAPM Rubber Fiber Caps and CAPSM Metal Threaded Fiber Caps for SMA-terminated ends are also offered separately. Please visit our Round-to-Linear Bundles Page or Linear-to-Linear Bundles Page for full product details. We also offer 4-to-1 Fan-Out Cables with Linear Common End Configurations . Thorlabs offers a wavelength and amplitude recalibration service for our Compact CCD Spectrometers. To ensure accurate measurements, we recommend recalibrating the devices every 24 months. The table to the right lists the spectrometers for which the CAL-CCS2 recalibration service is available.

The CCS100 and CCS175 operate in the 350 - 700 nm and 500 - 1000 nm spectral ranges with 0.5 nm and 0.6 nm resolution, respectively. The extended-range CCS200 operates in the 200 - 1000 nm spectral range with 2.0 nm resolution, but the UV range may be heavily attenuated when analyzing broadband spectra.</p> <p><strong>Light Sources</strong><br>The SLS201L</a> tungsten-halogen fiber-coupled light source delivers a 2796 K blackbody-type spectrum in the 360 - 2600 nm wavelength range and has active electronic stabilization for low spectral and intensity drift. Alternatively, the SLS203F</a> Globar fiber-coupled light source provides a 1500 K temperature and 500 - 9000 nm emission range. We also offer fiber-coupled LEDs</a> available with a selection of peak wavelengths or a broadband white-light emission spectra and our line of fiber-coupled laser sources</a> offers a selection of options for intense single-wavelength illumination.</p> <div class=\"imgFloatRight\" style=\"width: 170px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px;\">Click to Enlarge</a><br>Diffuse Measurement Taken at 45\u00b0 Using RPH Holder Block</div> <p><strong>Reflection Probe Fiber Bundles</strong><br>Thorlabs offers reflection probes</a> with either high-OH or low-OH multimode fiber for wavelengths from 250 - 1200 nm and 400 - 2400 nm, respectively.

These fiber bundle cables are commonly used to increase the coupling efficiency into spectrometers that have an entrance slit, such as those sold above. The linear end matches the shape of the entrance slit better than a single fiber or round bundle configuration, and therefore increases the amount of light entering the spectrometer. These fiber bundles use SMA905 connectors for compatibility with most spectrometers. They are built with \u00d8105 \u00b5m or \u00d8200 \u00b5m core Thorlabs multimode fiber with either a high or a low hydroxyl ion (OH) content for 250 - 1200 nm or 400 - 2400 nm, respectively.</p> <p>When plugging the linear end of the bundle cable into the spectrometer or another device, the fiber array must be aligned with the entrance slit. For ease of alignment, the fiber array's axis is indicated by a line on the connector sleeve. Precise alignment of the bundle and slit is not critical, but misalignment of more than \u00b15\u00b0 can cause a reduction in signal strength. In order to maximize signal intensity, we recommend rotating the bundle while monitoring light levels in the spectrometer, and then tightening down the threaded portion of the SMA connector to lock the bundle in place. When using these bundles with our CCD Spectrometers, the fiber array should be oriented vertically.</p> <p>Each patch cable includes two rubber and two metal protective caps that shield the connector ends from dust and other hazards. Additional CAPM</a> Rubber Fiber Caps and CAPSM</a> Metal Threaded Fiber Caps for SMA-terminated ends are also offered separately.</p> <p>Please visit our Round-to-Linear Bundles Page</a> or Linear-to-Linear Bundles Page</a> for full product details.
